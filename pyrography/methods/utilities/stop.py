        This method disconnects the client from Telegram and stops the underlying tasks.

        Parameters:
            block (``bool``, *optional*):
                Blocks the code execution until the client has been stopped. It is useful with ``block=False`` in case
                you want to stop the own client *within* a handler in order not to cause a deadlock.
                Defaults to True.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrography.Client`: The stopped client itself.

        Raises:
            ConnectionError: In case you try to stop an already stopped client.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                from pyrography import Client

                app = Client("my_account")
